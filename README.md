# Roll a Ball Project

- In this practice we are going to create a game with a ball in Unity. Specifically this game consists of the following:
- The first scene is the start menu of the game "Start Game".
  - In the second scene, the ball has to pick up all the cubes on the screen. Once all the cubes are collected, the message "You Win" will be displayed, but to go to another scene you must access the last platform, whose material is "Space".

## Getting Started 🚀

In order to develop this game, the following steps have been taken:
  - Completing the tutorial hosted on the Unity platform.
  - Researching to add new elements in the game, such as jumping, swapping between scenes, adding textures....


### Pre-requisites 📋

Have Unity and Visual Studio installed.
Aspects to take into account: so that visual studio detects the variables and can perform the autocompletion. You must close the IDE and in the Unity program, go to Edit/Preferences/External Tools and in the External Script Editor option, choose Visual Studio.
